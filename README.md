Skillcraft-Tasks
This repository is a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects implemented in Python, primarily using Jupyter/Colab notebooks. It demonstrates end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, statistical summarization, and basic predictive modeling.

Key areas of focus include:

Traffic accident data analysis: uncovering patterns by weather, lighting, time, and contributing factors.

Demographic analytics: visualizing and interpreting age and gender distributions from census data.

Property and business datasets: statistical exploration, data cleaning, and feature analysis.

Visualization: clear, actionable charts (bar graphs, heatmaps, correlations) using matplotlib and seaborn.

Predictive analytics: introductory machine learning modeling with scikit-learn, including decision tree classifiers.

All notebooks and scripts are organized by task and designed for clarity, reproducibility, and professional portfolio use.
